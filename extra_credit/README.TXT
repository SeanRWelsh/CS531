This is a simple demonstration of a linked list to
     1. Create a list
     2. Display the list
     3. Reverse the list
     4. Sort the list
     5. Search a name on the list
     6. Add a node at a random position on the list
     7. Delete a node from the list
     8. Delete the entire list

INSTRUCTIONS:
To run the program from the project directory
       1. make all (this will create object files under build_obj directory)	
       2. make run (executable is under application directory)
       3. make clean to delete some duplicate files and object files	
       4. make rebuild will clean all the object files and rebuilds again.
