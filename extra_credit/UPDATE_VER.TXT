Version:	1.0	
Version:        1.1 (Basic upgrade)
Version:	1.2 Table is added in this upgrade. This table keeps track of duplicate names & tabulates them and
		    displays in a sorted manner. Additional sort function is added in the sort.c file to sort the
		    newly created list that stores the name and its number of occurence. 
Version:        1.3 (Delete function needs to be made more robust than it is right now.....in progress......!!!!!!!)
		      1. Makefile is updated.... build folder is changed to build_obj which saves
		         all the object files
		      2. executable output directory is changed to application
		      3. clear is deleted from the Makefile
		      4. Delete function was cleaned to make it more efficient. There were some duplicates.
		         After deleting the node, pointer was moving back to the first node therefore spending
			 more time to go thru the list. This is solved.
		      5. More comments are added. 
Version:	1.4 Undo and Redo features to be added in this upgrade.
		      1. Keep track of history. if deleted, insert. if inserted, delete
		      Note: CS531 students can add this function to this program. 
Version:        1.5 (Future Upgrade.... to be considered)
